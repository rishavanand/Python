# Little Python scripts

This repo has small scripts that I've written just to play with the language or to do some basic tasks. These can be used to build something exciting or can be extended to provide new features. New scripts will be added as new ideas emerge and as I go on exploring new branches of the language. A short description for each script has been added below.
